# Compiler 2020 Manual

## Stage: Manual v2, Testset v0.2A + Judge Server In progress

File: Compiler 2020 Manual-v3.pdf

- Fixed many bugs

Semantic Testset: Current 169

## Proposed Requirements

**Not the final version!!!**

90% for Rank score, 10% for presentation and others. DDL: 12th - 13th week.   
3 parts: Semantic, Codegen, Optimize.   
Whatever the structure you use is acceptable, but special judgement and directly copying code is totally prohibited. If you tried, you will directly get zero.  
The server may contain many bugs and it's welcomed to give good advice for repairing but any devastating action without notifying to TAs in time(typically within 12 hours(?)) will lead to a cup of tea.:)  
Hope you all enjoy this course.
